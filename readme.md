# Concepts

<details>
<summary>🗺️ DataMappers</summary>

- A pattern to transfer bidirecional data between the *domain* and the *persistence*. In this application case, between the frontend and the backend.

<details>
<summary>🗺️ Container/Presentational Component Pattern</summary>

- Logic + UI mixed
- Big Components
- More chances to break the code
- Manutability and scability worst
- Components with so much responsability (SRP of SOLID)
- The objective of this pattern is to **break apart Logic and the UI**
