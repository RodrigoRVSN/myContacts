# Concepts

<details>
<summary>🗺️ DataMappers</summary>

- A pattern to transfer bidirecional data between the *domain* and the *persistence*. In this application case, between the frontend and the backend.

<details>
<summary>🗺️ Container/Presentational Component Pattern</summary>

- Logic + UI mixed
- Big Components
- More chances to break the code
- Manutability and scability worst
- Components with so much responsability (SRP of SOLID)
- The objective of this pattern is to **break apart Logic and the UI**

<summary>📦 Update package versions</summary>

1. Hover the packages in `package.json` to see the actual version 
2. Use the VSCode extension `Version Lens` to check outdated versions
3. Use the CLI Command `npm outdated`
4. Use the package `npm-check-updates`

We can see the versioning meanings in the site [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org)
